Typically, it is a one-semester course, which means it may span around 15 to 18 weeks in a traditional academic setting. Some schools may choose to offer it as a full-year course, in which case it would last for around 30 to 36 weeks. As for the AP Physics C Mechanics exam, it is a 3-hour long test. The exam is divided into two parts:Multiple-Choice Section: This section consists of 35 multiple-choice questions. Students have 45 minutes to complete this part. Calculators are not allowed for this section.Free-Response Section: This section includes 3 free-response questions, and students have 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete it. The questions may involve a mix of analytical problem-solving, experimental analysis, and conceptual explanations.The entire exam is worth a total of 45% of the final AP Physics C Mechanics score, while the remaining 55% is typically based on the students performance in the course itself, including classwork, labs, and other assessments.",
